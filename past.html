			<h2>Where I come from....</h2><p>I was born in La Plata, Argentina.
			Where I grow up with my mum and dad, and my three brothers. <br> During primary school, I attended school in the morning and art school in the afternoons, and by 4th grade, I knew that I really like music.<br> I started to study flute, but I had to drop it when I started high school, I was too cool and with all the dating and partying with my friends I didn't have enough time for music.<br> When I finished high school, I try different careers but I couldn't find what was right for me, and by the age of 23 I moved abroad.</p>
